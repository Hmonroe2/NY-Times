## Wins and Challenges 
- The first area of code I was particularly proud of was my buttons on my nav bar. I wanted to ensure that none of the buttons would take you to a blank page because nothing is more frustrating for a user. So to mitigate this issue I built the buttons using the data, not hard coding them. This allows the buttons to change based on the articles for the day.<img width="415" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-12 at 2 31 36 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102885322/212363303-847be09b-144b-4c98-85c8-0ffcf0b8c8a3.png">
- A challegne for me was that some of the data didnâ€™t contain an image link and the null reading would crash the app. I found a solution using a ternary operator.

## Features
  - As, a user, I should be able to navigate to a home page, 
  and view a list of todays top stories.
  - As a user, I should be able to click a story and be taken to 
  more details about the article. 
  - As a user, I should be able to be redirected to NY times to read
  the full article. 
  - As a user, I should be able to filter the articles by topic from 
  the buttons at the top. 
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Future extension would be testing the application using cypress.  
  - Future extension would change the Navbar to have hamburger icon when it is in mobile view.
